# Performance Environment Version 2
## Vincent Giles, 2019

This is an update on my original performance environment built in 2015 in Max 6. 
As Max has developed significantly since, it seemed a good idea to update it prior to starting to play live again.
This version removes some functionality (such as live sampling) which may be able to be added later if desired, makes a new set of effects, and removes the granulator.
It also redoes the buffers with polybuffer and all the playback through the new mc functionality, adding in a more traditional sampler (sort of). 

Ready for live use as at 08/06/2019. Branch is where new features are to be added, master is only for bug fixes.
